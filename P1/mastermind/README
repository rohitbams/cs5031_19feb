This repository is meant to be an implementation of the Mastermind
Word game, for P1 of CS5031.

A Maven build script has been provided.

Use
```
./mvnw compile
```
to compile the code. Note that for all these commands, replace `mvnw`
by `mvnw.cmd` if you are on Windows. Also, the `-q` flag can be used
to cut down the amount of output produced by Maven.

To test, use
```
./mvnw test
```

A `jar` package can be produced by
```
./mvnw package
```

The program can be run, either by Maven, using
```
./mvnw exec:java
```
or from the packaged jar, using
```
java -cp target/mastermind-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar stacs.example.MastermindApp
```

Finally, the built or partially built products (in the target
directory) can be deleted by using
```
./mvnw clean
```
