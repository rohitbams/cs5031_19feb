Master Mind Word - Development Report
1. Introduction
Briefly introduce the project.
Explain the aim: Implementing a Master Mind-style word game using Test-Driven Development (TDD), Maven, and Git.
Mention key technologies used (Java, JUnit 5, Maven, Git).
Outline the structure of the report.
2. Implementation Overview
Describe how the game works (How to Play section).
Explain the game logic:
Selecting a random word from the wordlist.
Accepting user input and validating it.
Generating feedback based on correct letters and positions.
Tracking the number of guesses and determining a win/loss.
Mention the command-line interface (CLI) and how the user interacts with the game.
Highlight any additional features implemented beyond the base requirements.
3. Test-Driven Development Approach
Define Test-Driven Development (TDD) and why it was used.
Describe how you wrote tests before implementing functionality.
Explain the process:
Writing unit tests for small components.
Implementing the functionality to pass the tests.
Refactoring and improving the implementation.
Provide examples of key tests written (e.g., verifying word selection, input validation, feedback mechanism).
Discuss challenges faced and how you overcame them.
4. Refactoring Approach
Define refactoring and its importance in improving code quality.
Explain when and why refactoring was done.
List specific improvements:
Enhancing readability and maintainability.
Reducing code duplication.
Improving performance (if applicable).
Mention tools or techniques used (e.g., Extract Method, Rename Variable, Remove Redundancy).
5. Other Software Development Practices Used
Discuss version control (Git):
How commits were structured to show incremental development.
Use of branches (if applicable).
Examples of meaningful commit messages.
Describe error handling (e.g., handling invalid input, missing word list).
Mention coding standards followed (naming conventions, documentation using JavaDoc).
If applicable, discuss dependency management with Maven and how build automation helped.
6. Additional Features (If Implemented)
List any extra features added beyond the base requirements.
Explain why they were added and how they enhance the game.
Discuss any trade-offs made (e.g., increased complexity vs. improved user experience).
7. Conclusion
Summarize key takeaways from the project.
Reflect on the learning experience and what could be improved.
Mention any future improvements or extensions you would consider.
8. References
List any references used for Java, TDD, Maven, or other technical concepts.
Follow a consistent citation format (e.g., Harvard, IEEE).
Getting Started with Writing
Start with an outline: Expand on each section with key points.
Keep it concise: The word limit is 800 words, so avoid unnecessary details.
Use diagrams/code snippets where useful (e.g., showing test cases or refactoring examples).
Proofread for clarity and coherence.
